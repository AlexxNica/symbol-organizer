Also provides the ability to choose the granularity of the groups, reverse the layer list sort direction, layout symbols horizontally or vertically, set a maximum of symbols per row/column, and to remove any unused symbols (will ignore symbols which are nested symbols, which containâ€©nested symbols, or are used as overrides).
