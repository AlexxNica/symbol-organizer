Organize your symbols page alphabetically (including layer list) and into groupings determined by your symbol names. Also provides the ability to choose the granularity of the groups, reverse the layer list sort direction, layout symbols horizontally or vertically, set a maximum of symbols per row/column, gather symbols from other pages, and to remove any unused symbols (will ignore nested symbols, symbols with nested symbols, symbols used as overrides, or symbols that reside on pages other than the Symbols page).
